For this, I have created a folder of Frontend-Translator in the root directory of project_udaan, and created an app.py file that reflects the backend as above.
-C:\Users\hp>cd Downloads
-C:\Users\hp\Downloads>cd project_udaan
-C:\Users\hp\Downloads\project_udaan>cd Frontend-Translator
-C:\Users\hp\Downloads\project_udaan\Frontend-Translator>pip install streamlit
After installing the streamlit 
-C:\Users\hp\Downloads\project_udaan\Frontend-Translator>streamlit run app.py
